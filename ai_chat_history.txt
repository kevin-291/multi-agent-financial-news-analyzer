AI Development History - Financial News Analysis Project
========================================================

**You:** I'm working on a financial news analysis system using AI agents. I want to extract entities, analyze sentiment, and predict market impact. What's the best architecture approach?

**Assistant:** For a multi-agent financial analysis system, I'd recommend a pipeline architecture where each agent has a specific responsibility:

1. Entity Extraction Agent - Extract companies, tickers, investment amounts, sectors
2. Sentiment Analysis Agent - Determine positive/negative/neutral sentiment with confidence scores  
3. Market Impact Agent - Predict short-term and long-term market effects

Each agent should be independent but able to pass data between them. Consider using a framework like Pydantic AI for structured outputs and validation.

**You:** I'm using Pydantic AI with Ollama. How should I structure the prompts for entity extraction to avoid hallucination?

**Assistant:** The key is being very explicit about what to extract and what to return as null. Here's the approach:

- Be specific about input sources: "Only use the given article headline and content"
- Explicitly state "Do NOT hallucinate or reference external knowledge"
- Define exact JSON schema with specific field types
- Use clear examples like "($50 billion â†’ 50000000000)" for investment amounts
- Specify ticker format: "only if explicitly written like (NASDAQ: TSLA)"

Make sure to validate that if information isn't explicitly mentioned, the agent returns null rather than guessing.

**You:** I'm having trouble with JSON extraction from the LLM responses. Sometimes it comes wrapped in markdown code blocks. Any suggestions?

**Assistant:** Yes, LLMs often wrap JSON in code blocks. Here's a utility function approach:

```python
import json
import re

def extract_json_from_response(text: str) -> dict:
    text = text.strip()
    # Remove markdown code block wrappers
    if text.startswith("```json") or text.startswith("```"):
        text = re.sub(r"^```(?:json)?\s*", "", text)
        text = re.sub(r"\s*```$", "", text)
    
    try:
        return json.loads(text)
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid JSON format: {e}")
```

This handles both plain JSON and markdown-wrapped responses.

**You:** For the sentiment analysis agent, what's the best way to ensure consistent output format?

**Assistant:** Use strict schema validation and clear constraints in your prompt:

- Limit sentiment to exactly three values: "positive", "neutral", "negative"
- Use regex patterns in Pydantic models for validation
- Specify confidence score as float between 0.0 and 1.0
- Be explicit: "Do NOT include explanations, assumptions, or unrelated text"
- Use the phrase "STRICT FORMAT (JSON only)" to emphasize structure

The prompt should focus on analyzing only the given text without external context.

**You:** How should the market impact agent integrate data from the other two agents?

**Assistant:** The market impact agent should receive a context object that combines outputs from both previous agents:

```python
impact_context = {
    "headline": article["headline"],
    "content": article["content"], 
    "sentiment": sentiment_data["sentiment"],
    "confidence_score": sentiment_data["confidence_score"],
    "sector": entity_data["sector"],
    "investment_usd": entity_data["investment_usd"]
}
```

The agent prompt should explicitly state: "Use these inputs strictly. Do not hallucinate or assume any details." This ensures it only works with verified data from previous agents.

**You:** I want to set up proper evaluation for these agents. What's a good approach for testing accuracy?

**Assistant:** For evaluation, I'd suggest:

1. Create ground truth datasets with expected outputs for each agent
2. Use the pydantic-evals library for structured testing
3. Build custom accuracy evaluators that compare field-by-field
4. Test each agent independently plus the full pipeline

Create test cases with realistic financial articles and expected outputs. For accuracy measurement, count correct fields divided by total fields. This gives you granular feedback on what each agent is getting right or wrong.

**You:** I'm having issues with async execution when running all agents in sequence. The pipeline isn't working smoothly.

**Assistant:** For async pipeline execution, make sure you're properly awaiting each step and handling the data flow:

```python
async def run_all_agents(article):
    # Run entity extraction first
    entity_result = await entity_extraction_agent(article).run(article)
    entity_data = extract_json_from_response(entity_result.output)
    
    # Run sentiment analysis  
    sentiment_result = await sentiment_analysis_agent(article).run(article)
    sentiment_data = extract_json_from_response(sentiment_result.output)
    
    # Combine for market impact
    impact_context = {**article_data, **sentiment_data, **entity_data}
    market_result = await market_impact_agent(impact_context).run(impact_context)
    
    return combined_results
```

Use `asyncio.gather()` for batch processing multiple articles concurrently.

**You:** What's the best way to handle model configuration and make it easily switchable between different models?

**Assistant:** Create a centralized model configuration function:

```python
def model():
    return OpenAIModel(
        model_name='gemma3:1b',
        provider=OpenAIProvider(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1')
    )
```

This way you can easily switch models by changing just this function. Import it in each agent file and use the same instance. You could also add environment variables or config files to make it even more flexible.

**You:** For the evaluation setup, how do I structure test cases that work with pydantic-evals?

**Assistant:** Structure your test cases using the Case class with proper evaluators:

```python
from pydantic_evals import Case, Dataset
from pydantic_evals.evaluators import IsInstance

# Create cases for each test scenario
entity_cases = [
    Case(
        name=article["article_id"],
        inputs=article,
        expected_output=expected_entities[article["article_id"]],
        evaluators=[IsInstance(type_name="dict"), AccuracyEvaluator()]
    )
    for article in test_articles
]

dataset = Dataset(cases=entity_cases)
```

Build custom evaluators that compare expected vs actual outputs field by field for accuracy scoring.

**You:** The evaluation is running but I want to test the full pipeline, not just individual agents. How should I structure that?

**Assistant:** For pipeline evaluation, create wrapper functions that run the full pipeline but return specific outputs:

```python
async def run_entity(article): 
    return (await run_pipeline(article))["entity"]

async def run_sentiment(article): 
    return (await run_pipeline(article))["sentiment"]
```

This lets you test end-to-end performance while still evaluating each component separately. You can then run evaluations on each component using the same test data but different output extractors.

**You:** Everything is working but the agents sometimes return inconsistent results. Any tips for improving reliability?

**Assistant:** For better reliability:

1. Add more specific constraints in prompts ("must be one of exactly these values")
2. Use Pydantic Field validators with regex patterns
3. Add error handling in your JSON extraction
4. Consider adding retry logic for malformed responses
5. Use temperature=0 in your model config for more consistent outputs
6. Add validation that checks if required fields are present

The key is being extremely prescriptive in your prompts and having robust validation at each step.
